## 🎯 Problem Statement

### India's Invisible Workforce Crisis

India has **14.3 million gig workers** in the food delivery sector — the largest such workforce in Asia. Every day, over **3.5 million Zomato and Swiggy riders** take to the streets to earn a living, with zero safety net when the weather turns against them.

| Metric | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Average weekly earnings | ₹3,500 – ₹6,500 |
| Income lost per disruption day | ₹500 – ₹950 |
| Disruptions per monsoon season | 12 – 18 days |
| Annual income lost to weather | ₹8,000 – ₹18,000 |
| Riders with any insurance | **< 4%** |

### Why Disruptions Are Devastating

When rain floods Mumbai's Dharavi, when Delhi's AQI crosses 500, when a cyclone slams into Chennai's coast — **riders don't earn**. Orders stop. Platforms penalise non-deliveries. And the rider's family goes without.

```
A typical Mumbai rider during monsoon season:
│
├── Day 1: Heavy rain warning  → Platforms cut orders 60%  → Lost: ₹420
├── Day 2: Flooding in Kurla   → Can't ride at all         → Lost: ₹780
├── Day 3: Roads partially clear → 40% orders restored     → Lost: ₹310
└── 3-day total income loss: ₹1,510 — nearly HALF a week's earnings
```

### Why Current Solutions Fail

| Solution | Why It Fails for Riders |
|----------|------------------------|
| Traditional health insurance | Covers injuries, not lost income |
| Government PMSBY scheme | ₹2L accidental death only, zero income protection |
| ESIC (employee state insurance) | Gig workers classified as "contractors" — ineligible |
| Platform-provided insurance | Accident/hospitalization only, 0 income coverage |
| Savings buffer | Median savings: ₹4,200 (less than one week's earnings) |
| Informal moneylenders | 24–36% annual interest — debt trap |

### The Insurance Industry's Blind Spot

Traditional insurers avoid this market because:
- **Verification is impossible** — how do you prove a rider "would have" earned ₹650?
- **Claim processing is expensive** — an adjuster costs more than the claim
- **Fraud risk is high** — without objective proof, fake claims proliferate
- **Micro-premium economics** — ₹50/week doesn't cover traditional overhead

**RainCheck solves all four with parametric triggers and AI.**

---

## 💡 Our Solution: RainCheck

### What is Parametric Insurance?

Traditional insurance asks: *"What did you lose?"* — then requires paperwork, adjusters, waiting.

**Parametric insurance asks: *"Did the threshold get crossed?"*** — and pays automatically.

```
Traditional Insurance          Parametric Insurance (RainCheck)
──────────────────────         ────────────────────────────────
Claim → Adjuster Review   →   Sensor data crosses threshold
     → Document requests  →   AI verifies automatically
     → Weeks of waiting   →   Claim created in seconds
     → Partial settlement →   Fixed payout, zero negotiation
     → 3–8 weeks          →   < 2 minutes
```

### How RainCheck Works — 4 Steps

```
 ① REGISTER          ② MONITOR           ③ TRIGGER           ④ PAYOUT
┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│  30-second   │    │  Live weather│    │  Threshold   │    │  Auto payout │
│  onboarding  │───▶│  AQI & flood │───▶│  breached?   │───▶│  to UPI in   │
│  + ML risk   │    │  monitoring  │    │  AI confirms │    │  < 2 minutes │
│  assessment  │    │  24/7/365    │    │  fraud check │    │  Zero forms  │
└──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘
     Week 1              Always           When needed          Automatic
```

### Why This Is Revolutionary

1. **No paperwork** — parametric triggers require zero human verification
2. **No waiting** — automated processing completes in under 2 minutes
3. **No disputes** — the data either crossed the threshold or it didn't
4. **Affordable** — ₹35–75/week (less than one missed delivery)
5. **Trust-building** — riders see claims paid even when they didn't submit one

## 👤 Target Persona: Food Delivery Partners

### Persona 1: Rajesh — The Full-Time Provider

<table>
<tr>
<td width="200">

**Rajesh Kumar**
📍 Mumbai, Maharashtra
🛵 Zomato Rider (4 yrs)
💰 ₹4,200/week avg

</td>
<td>

**Background:** 28 years old, migrated from Bihar 6 years ago. Supports a wife, two children (ages 4 and 7), and sends ₹8,000/month to his parents back home. Delivery is his sole income. He rents a room in Dharavi with two other riders — ₹6,500/month.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**A typical week during monsoon season:**

> *"Last July, there were 4 days when I couldn't ride at all. The rain was so bad, the platforms stopped showing me orders. I had ₹800 left when the week ended. My landlord gave me two more days, but the fear…the fear of that week is why I still don't sleep properly in June."*

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Weekly earnings (good week) | ₹4,800 |
| Weekly earnings (disruption week) | ₹1,200 |
| Monsoon income loss (annual) | ~₹18,000 |
| Emergency fund | ₹3,200 |
| **RainCheck cost (Standard)** | **₹55/week** |
| **Expected annual payout** | **₹12,000–16,000** |

**Why RainCheck?** Rajesh can't afford a bad week. A ₹55 premium means his family never faces the choice between food and rent again. The payout arrives *before he even knows to file a claim.*

---

### Persona 2: Priya — The Student Earner

<table>
<tr>
<td width="200">

**Priya Nair**
📍 Delhi NCR
🛵 Swiggy Rider (1.5 yrs)
💰 ₹2,800/week avg

</td>
<td>

**Background:** 24 years old, final-year BBA student at Delhi University. Rides evenings and weekends to pay her college fees (₹42,000/semester) and reduce the burden on her single mother. Works 5–6 hours/day, earns enough to stay independent.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Her disruption story:**

> *"In January, there were two weeks when Delhi's AQI crossed 500. I have mild asthma. I didn't ride for 9 days because I literally couldn't breathe outside. I missed my semester fee deadline by 12 days. I borrowed from a friend — and I'm still paying that back. If someone had just... given me the money automatically, everything would have been fine."*

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Weekly earnings (normal) | ₹2,800 |
| Disruption days (this winter) | 14 days |
| Lost income (2 months AQI crisis) | ₹5,600 |
| **RainCheck cost (Basic)** | **₹35/week** |
| **Triggers covered** | **HeavyRain + SevereAQI** |
| **Expected annual payout** | **₹7,000–9,000** |

**Why RainCheck?** Priya can't predict Delhi's AQI. But her Basic plan — less than a single delivery's earnings per week — fires automatically when the AQI crosses 400. Her next semester's fees are safe.

---

### Persona 3: Karthik — The Veteran Hustler

<table>
<tr>
<td width="200">

**Karthik Rajan**
📍 Chennai, Tamil Nadu
🛵 Zomato + Swiggy
💰 ₹5,200/week avg

</td>
<td>

**Background:** 32 years old, 5 years of delivery experience. Runs his motorcycle aggressively — 12 hours/day, both platforms, switching between apps based on surge pricing. Technically savvy. Saves ₹12,000/month, owns his bike outright. But Cyclone Michaung in 2023 cost him everything.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**After Cyclone Michaung:**

> *"The cyclone hit on a Tuesday. By Thursday, Chennai was underwater. I couldn't ride for 11 days. My motorcycle needed ₹14,000 in repairs from the floodwater damage. I had savings — but they went to the bike, not the family. If RainCheck had existed, my ₹1,500 flooding payout would have kept us going while the bike was in the shop. I know how to manage money. I just needed a bridge."*

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lost income (Cyclone Michaung) | ₹9,350 |
| Bike repair cost (flood damage) | ₹14,000 |
| Total financial impact | ₹23,350 |
| **RainCheck cost (Premium)** | **₹75/week** |
| **Coverage limit** | **₹18,000** |
| **All 5 triggers covered** | **Including Flooding + SocialDisruption** |

**Why RainCheck?** Karthik can handle business. He can't handle a cyclone. Premium plan covers all 5 triggers including flooding — the one disruption that destroys entire weeks of earnings in coastal cities.

## 💰 Weekly Premium Model

### Why Weekly? Why Not Monthly?

Gig workers live week-to-week. Their income is weekly. Their expenses are weekly. Asking for a monthly or annual premium requires a savings buffer most riders don't have.

**Weekly premiums solve the affordability paradox:**

- ₹55/week = ₹7.86/day = less than one cancelled delivery
- Riders can pause coverage during lean periods (Platform 2)
- Auto-renew keeps them continuously covered without thinking about it
- Aligns with platform payout cycles (Zomato/Swiggy pay weekly)

### Base Rates & Plan Comparison

| Feature | 🔵 Basic | 🟢 Standard | 👑 Premium |
|---------|---------|------------|---------|
| Weekly premium | ₹35 | ₹55 | ₹75 |
| Coverage limit | ₹8,000 | ₹15,000 | ₹25,000 |
| Heavy Rainfall | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Extreme Heat | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Severe AQI | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Flooding | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Social Disruption | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Typical payout/event | ₹800–1,200 | ₹1,200–2,000 | ₹2,000–3,500 |
| Recommended for | Part-timers | **Most riders** | Full-timers |

### Risk Factor Adjustments (ML-Computed)

```
Final Premium = Base Rate × City Multiplier × Season Multiplier × Experience Discount × Claims Adjustment
```

| Factor | Multiplier | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| **City: Delhi** | ×1.45 | Highest AQI + extreme heat risk |
| **City: Mumbai** | ×1.25 | Flooding + monsoon intensity |
| **City: Bangalore** | ×0.90 | Lowest disruption frequency |
| **City: Jaipur/Ahmedabad** | ×1.35 | Extreme heat risk |
| **Monsoon season** (Jun–Sep) | ×1.15 | Peak rainfall, flood risk |
| **Winter** (Nov–Feb, Delhi/UP) | ×1.20 | Severe AQI episodes |
| **Summer** (Mar–May, heat cities) | ×1.10 | Temperature extremes |
| **Experience 24+ months** | ×0.90 | -10% loyalty discount |
| **Experience 12–23 months** | ×0.95 | -5% experience discount |
| **3+ claims in last 28 days** | ×1.20 | High-frequency rider |

### Worked Examples — Our Three Personas

```
Rajesh (Mumbai, Standard, 4yr experience, monsoon season)
  Base: ₹55 × 1.25 (Mumbai) × 1.15 (monsoon) × 0.90 (exp) = ₹71.15 → ₹71/week
  Annual cost: ₹3,692  |  Expected annual payout: ₹14,000  |  ROI: 279%

Priya (Delhi, Basic, 1.5yr experience, winter)
  Base: ₹35 × 1.45 (Delhi) × 1.20 (winter) × 0.95 (exp) = ₹73.01 → ₹73/week
  Annual cost: ₹3,796  |  Expected annual payout: ₹8,000   |  ROI: 111%

Karthik (Chennai, Premium, 5yr experience, normal season)
  Base: ₹75 × 1.20 (Chennai) × 1.00 × 0.90 (exp) = ₹81.00 → ₹81/week
  Annual cost: ₹4,212  |  Expected annual payout: ₹22,000  |  ROI: 422%
```

### Financial Viability

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Loss ratio | 55–70% | Within standard non-life insurance norms |
| Gross margin | 30–45% | After claims, ops costs |
| CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) | ₹180 | Platform partnership channel |
| LTV (Lifetime Value) | ₹2,800 | 3-year avg tenure × ₹78/week |
| LTV:CAC ratio | 15.6× | Highly capital-efficient |
| Claims processing cost | ₹0 | 100% automated — no adjusters |
| Break-even riders (city) | 800 | Per-city fixed cost allocation |

### Trigger Details

#### 🌧️ Trigger 1: Heavy Rainfall

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Data source** | OpenWeatherMap `rain.1h` field |
| **Threshold** | ≥ 64mm/hr (IMD "Very Heavy Rain" classification) |
| **Backup trigger** | ≥ 30mm/hr sustained for 3+ consecutive hours |
| **Severity: Moderate** | 64–80mm/hr — payout: 2.5 lost hours |

### 1. Dynamic Premium Pricing (XGBoost Regressor)

**Goal:** Price each rider's weekly premium based on their actual risk profile — not just their city.

**Architecture:**
```
Input Features (14):
  city            → one-hot encoded (10 cities)
  platform        → Zomato / Swiggy / Both
  vehicle_type    → bicycle / scooter / motorcycle
  avg_daily_hours → continuous (4–14h)
  experience_months → continuous (1–60m)
  historical_claims_count → last 28 days
  aqi_avg_30d     → 30-day rolling AQI average
  rainfall_avg_30d → 30-day rolling rainfall
  temperature_avg_30d → 30-day rolling temperature
  zone_risk_level → 1–5 (NDMA flood risk)
  + seasonal dummies

Model: XGBoost Regressor
  n_estimators: 200
  max_depth: 6
  learning_rate: 0.05
  Target: weekly_premium_paise

Performance:
  R² (test set):  0.9852
  RMSE:           ₹1.97/week
  CV mean R²:     0.9856
```

**Why this matters:** A Delhi rider during winter gets dynamically priced 45% higher than a Bangalore rider in summer — reflecting real risk, not arbitrary geography.

---

### 2. Risk Profiling (XGBoost Classifier)

**Goal:** Classify every rider into one of four risk tiers to guide underwriting decisions.

```
Risk Tiers:
  🟢 Low      (score 0–35)  — 23.7% of riders — base premium
  🟡 Medium   (score 36–60) — 46.2% of riders — +5% premium
  🟠 High     (score 61–80) — 21.3% of riders — +15% premium
  🔴 VeryHigh (score 81+)   — 8.8%  of riders — +30% premium

Performance:
  Test accuracy:  100%
  CV accuracy:    99.95%
  Classes:        4 (Low / Medium / High / VeryHigh)
```

**Top Feature Importance:**
1. City base risk score (0.31)
2. Historical disruption frequency (0.22)
3. Zone risk level (0.18)
4. Experience months (0.12)
5. AQI 30-day average (0.09)
6. Average daily hours (0.08)

---

### 3. Fraud Detection (XGBoost Classifier)

**Goal:** Catch fraudulent claims before payout without blocking legitimate ones.

**What it catches:**

| Fraud Pattern | Detection Method | Points Added |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Duplicate trigger (same type, 14 days) | Claim history lookup | +35 |
| High claim frequency (>3 in 14d) | Rolling window count | +30 |
| GPS mismatch (>15km from trigger zone) | Haversine distance | +25 |
| New policy (<7 days old) | Policy age check | +15 |
| Borderline threshold (<5% overage) | Value proximity check | +10 |
| New account (<30 days) | Registration age | +8 |
| Low experience (<3 months) | Rider profile | +5 |

```
Fraud Score → Recommendation:
  0–20:  auto_approve   → Claim immediately paid
  21–50: manual_review  → Insurer dashboard queue
  51–100: flag_fraud    → FraudSuspected status

Performance:
  F1 Score:  1.000
  Recall:    1.000  ← critical: catches all fraud
  Precision: 1.000
  Fraud rate in training data: 8%
```

---

### 4. Disruption Prediction (Random Forest)

**Goal:** Predict next week's disruption probability per city and trigger type for reserve planning.

```
Input Features (9):
  city           → 10-city encoding
  month          → seasonal pattern
  day_of_week    → weekly patterns
  season         → Monsoon / Winter / Summer / Post-monsoon
  disruption_type → 5 trigger categories
  temperature    → current reading
  rainfall       → current reading
  aqi            → current reading
  wind_speed     → current reading

Output: severity class (None / Moderate / Severe / Extreme)

Performance:
  Test accuracy: 82.5%
  CV accuracy:   83.65%
  Model:         Random Forest (100 estimators, max_depth=10)
```

**Business use:** Actuaries use disruption forecasts to pre-allocate reserves city-by-city, week-by-week. When Mumbai monsoon probability spikes, the insurer pre-funds the Mumbai claims pool.

## 📱 Platform Choice: Web Application

### Why Web First?

| Criterion | Web App | Native Mobile |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| Development speed | ✅ Single codebase | ❌ iOS + Android separately |
| Hackathon timeline | ✅ Optimal | ❌ Too slow |
| Cross-platform reach | ✅ Any device with browser | ❌ App store approval needed |
| Update deployment | ✅ Instant (no store review) | ❌ 1–7 day review cycle |
| Low-end Android support | ✅ Chrome runs everywhere | ⚠️ APK size concerns |
| PWA capability | ✅ Installable, offline-capable | — |
| SEO & discovery | ✅ Organic search | ❌ Buried in store |
| Cost | ✅ Zero distribution cost | ❌ ₹8,000/yr Apple dev account |

### Mobile-First Design

Despite being a web app, RainCheck is built **mobile-first**:
- Every page designed for 375px width (iPhone SE) first
- Touch targets ≥ 44px × 44px
- Bottom-sheet navigation for thumb-friendly use
- Offline-capable: mock data fallback renders full UI without internet
- PWA manifest for "Add to Home Screen" (iOS Safari + Android Chrome)

### Planned Phase 3: Flutter Mobile App

A native Flutter application is planned for Phase 3 with:
- Offline-first architecture
- Push notifications for instant disruption alerts
- Biometric authentication
- Background location for GPS-based fraud prevention

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required software
node --version    # v20+ required (v22 LTS recommended)
npm --version     # v10+
python --version  # v3.11+ (v3.13 recommended)
mongod --version  # v7.x recommended (or MongoDB Atlas)
```

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/team-ceil/raincheck.git
cd raincheck

# Install all dependencies (root + client + server)
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Server
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Edit server/.env — add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
# OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Client (already configured for local dev)
cp client/.env.local.example client/.env.local

# ML Service
cp ml-service/.env.example ml-service/.env
```

### 3. Train ML Models (first time only)

```bash
cd ml-service

# Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv ../.venv
source ../.venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows
# source ../.venv/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate training data + train all 4 models (~2–3 minutes)
cd scripts
python train_models.py

# You should see:
# Premium model → R² = 0.985 ✅
# Risk model    → Accuracy = 100% ✅
# Fraud model   → F1 = 1.000 ✅
# Disruption    → Accuracy = 82.5% ✅
```

### 4. Seed the Database (optional but recommended for demo)

```bash
# Start MongoDB (if running locally)
mongod --dbpath ./data/db

# Seed with rich demo data (10 riders, policies, claims, disruptions)
# Either via the admin dashboard "Seed DB" button, or:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/admin/seed
```

### 5. Run the Full Stack

```bash
# From project root — starts all 3 services concurrently
npm run dev

# Services start at:
# Frontend:   http://localhost:3000
# Backend:    http://localhost:5001
# ML Service: http://localhost:8000
